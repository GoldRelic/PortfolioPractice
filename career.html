    <div id="career_text">I was born in <span>1944.</span> I began conducting my own <span>science experiments</span> at an early age and, in junior high school, started working with <span>electronics</span> by building radios and amplifiers. I graduated with an <span>engineering degree</span> from Tokyo Denki University in <span>1967</span>. I had originally planned to work for <span>Sony</span>, but <span>failed</span> the final round of the company's testing process, so i instead joined an <span>audio engineering company</span> called Takt in early 1967. But after completing my training there i was not put in the development department, so <span>i quit</span> a year later and looked for a new job, eventually accepting a job offer from a <span>communications company</span>. Before beginning work, i met an <span>old colleague</span> at a train station who told me about the work he was doing at <span>Taito</span>, which i found <span>interesting</span>. My friend told me that Taito were desperately <span>searching for new engineers</span>, so i decided to <span>join Taito</span> instead of the communications company.

        I joined Pacific Industries Ltd in 1968, a subsidiary of Taito Trading Company. I began working on <span>arcade electro-mechanical games</span>, developing the hit target shooting games Sky Fighter (1971) and Sky Fighter II. My bosses at Taito believed <span>transistor-transistor logic</span> (TTL) technology would play a significant role in the <span>arcade industry</span>, so they tasked me with investigating TTL technology as i was the company's only employee who knew how to work with integrated circuit (IC) technology, and one of the few engineers at any Japanese coin-op company with significant expertise in solid-state electronics.
        
        <span>I began working on video game development</span> in 1972. I was interested in <span>creating arcade video games</span>, so i spent six months <span>dissecting Atari's Pong arcade unit </span>and learning how the game's integrated circuits worked, and <span>began modifying the game</span>. I developed <span>Elepong</span> (similar to Pong), one of Japan's earliest locally produced arcade video games, released in 1973. I produced more than <span>ten video games</span> up until 1977, before <span>Space Invaders</span> was released in 1978.</div>
